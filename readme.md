## Description of Application
This application can be widely used for taking quizzes (e.g., KBA or practice quizzes). We can add as many questions as we want in this application. The fact that this quiz doesn't tell you your score instantly makes it user-friendly.

## Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
The implementation of a second event listener made this particularly difficult for me. I mean, I tried dividing my work between 2 or 3 event listeners initially, but it didn't work out well, so I kept only one. And that one event listener was sufficient enough to do all the work, so I added the second event listener just so that I could complete the requirements. Also, the use of parent-child-sibling relationships for navigation was pointless, as you can see document methods (e.g., document.querySelector()) were sufficient enough to complete the application.

## What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
Use CSS files to give more color to my application and effects so that the user may find it appealing.


## What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
I started my code right after understanding the requirements. I didn't look at the right flow to code; I just randomly started doing what I knew and started completing the requirements. What I should have done is made sure the application runs first. Even if it doesn't complete all the requirements, I should have made sure it runs first, and only then should I have focused step by step to complete the requirements by adding more features to the application.
